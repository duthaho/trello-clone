# Feature Specification: System Architecture Design

**Feature Branch**: `001-system-architecture`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "System Architecture Design: We are starting Stage 1: **System Architecture Design** for a SaaS Task Management Platform. Define what the system needs to achieve and why this architecture matters. An enterprise-grade SaaS platform that allows users to manage projects, tasks, and teams collaboratively — similar to Trello or Asana. We need a scalable, maintainable, and cloud-ready architecture that supports multi-user access and role-based permissions, real-time updates and background jobs, high performance and observability, smooth deployment on Docker + AWS."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Architecture Foundation Documentation (Priority: P1)

Technical architects and engineering leads need comprehensive architecture documentation that defines the system's core structure, component interactions, and design decisions to guide all subsequent development work.

**Why this priority**: Without a clear architectural foundation, development teams cannot make consistent technical decisions, leading to fragmented implementations and technical debt. This is the foundational document that enables all other work.

**Independent Test**: Architecture documentation can be validated by conducting design review sessions with engineering teams where participants can answer questions about system boundaries, component responsibilities, and data flow paths without ambiguity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new developer joins the team, **When** they read the architecture documentation, **Then** they can identify the purpose and boundaries of each core component (API layer, domain layer, persistence layer, async workers)
2. **Given** the architecture defines component interactions, **When** a developer needs to add a new feature, **Then** they can determine which components need changes and which remain unchanged
3. **Given** the architecture specifies technology choices, **When** infrastructure engineers review deployment requirements, **Then** they can provision the correct cloud resources (containers, databases, caching, message queues)

---

### User Story 2 - Scalability and Performance Guidelines (Priority: P1)

Development teams need clear guidance on scalability patterns and performance expectations so the system can handle growing user loads and data volumes without degradation.

**Why this priority**: Scalability concerns must be addressed from day one; retrofitting scalability into an existing monolithic system is exponentially more expensive. This ensures the architecture can grow with the business.

**Independent Test**: Scalability guidelines can be validated by creating load test scenarios based on documented thresholds (concurrent users, request latency, throughput) and verifying that the proposed architecture can meet these targets in test environments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** scalability guidelines define horizontal scaling approach, **When** load increases beyond single-server capacity, **Then** additional API server instances can be added without code changes
2. **Given** the architecture specifies stateless API design, **When** user requests are distributed across multiple servers, **Then** any server can handle any request without session affinity requirements
3. **Given** performance targets are documented (response times, throughput), **When** development teams implement features, **Then** they can design with these constraints in mind and validate against benchmarks

---

### User Story 3 - Security Architecture Blueprint (Priority: P1)

Security engineers and compliance teams need a comprehensive security architecture that defines authentication, authorization, data protection, and audit mechanisms to ensure the platform meets enterprise security standards.

**Why this priority**: Security vulnerabilities introduced during initial architecture design are difficult and costly to remediate later. Enterprise customers will not adopt a platform without demonstrated security controls.

**Independent Test**: Security architecture can be validated by conducting threat modeling sessions using STRIDE or similar frameworks, ensuring each identified threat has a documented mitigation strategy in the architecture.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the architecture defines authentication mechanisms, **When** security auditors review the design, **Then** they can verify that user credentials are protected using industry-standard practices (JWT tokens, OAuth2, encrypted storage)
2. **Given** the architecture specifies authorization model, **When** a user attempts to access resources, **Then** the system can enforce role-based permissions at both API and data layers
3. **Given** the architecture includes audit logging, **When** security-relevant events occur (login attempts, data access, permission changes), **Then** these events are captured with sufficient detail for compliance and forensics

---

### User Story 4 - Observability and Operations Framework (Priority: P2)

DevOps engineers and site reliability teams need a comprehensive observability framework defining logging, metrics, tracing, and monitoring strategies so they can operate the system effectively in production.

**Why this priority**: Production issues are inevitable; the ability to quickly diagnose and resolve problems is critical for maintaining SLA commitments and user trust. While P2 because the system can launch without full observability, it becomes P1 before production deployment.

**Independent Test**: Observability framework can be validated by simulating common production failure scenarios (database connection loss, high latency, service crashes) and verifying that monitoring dashboards and alerts provide sufficient information to diagnose root causes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the architecture defines structured logging standards, **When** application components log events, **Then** logs include correlation IDs, severity levels, and contextual information enabling trace reconstruction across distributed components
2. **Given** the architecture specifies key metrics to collect, **When** operations teams view monitoring dashboards, **Then** they can assess system health using RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) and business metrics (user registrations, task completions)
3. **Given** the architecture includes distributed tracing, **When** investigating performance issues, **Then** engineers can trace request flows across API, cache, database, and worker components to identify bottlenecks

---

### User Story 5 - Deployment and Infrastructure Strategy (Priority: P2)

Infrastructure engineers and DevOps teams need detailed deployment architecture defining containerization, orchestration, cloud resource provisioning, and environment management (dev/staging/production) to ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

**Why this priority**: Clear deployment strategy prevents environment inconsistencies and enables repeatable deployments. This is P2 because early development can use simplified local environments, but becomes critical before staging/production deployment.

**Independent Test**: Deployment architecture can be validated by provisioning environments according to specifications and verifying that applications can be deployed, scaled, and rolled back without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the architecture defines container specifications, **When** applications are packaged as Docker images, **Then** containers can run consistently across developer workstations, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud environments
2. **Given** the architecture specifies AWS ECS orchestration, **When** deploying to production, **Then** container instances are automatically managed, load-balanced, and monitored for health checks
3. **Given** the architecture defines environment separation, **When** deploying changes, **Then** code progresses through dev → staging → production with appropriate validation gates at each stage

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a core component (database, cache, message broker) becomes unavailable?** - Architecture must define graceful degradation strategies and fallback behaviors
- **How does the system handle traffic spikes that exceed designed capacity?** - Architecture should specify rate limiting, queuing, and load shedding mechanisms
- **What if architecture decisions prove incorrect during implementation?** - Document the amendment process for architecture decisions and migration strategies for already-implemented components
- **How are breaking changes to internal APIs managed?** - Define versioning strategy for internal service contracts and data schemas
- **What if regulatory requirements change (GDPR, data residency)?** - Architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate additional compliance requirements

### Key Entities

- **System Component**: Represents a major architectural element (API Gateway, Application Service, Domain Model, Repository, Cache, Message Queue, Worker). Each component has defined responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies, and scalability characteristics.

- **Bounded Context**: Represents a Domain-Driven Design context boundary (User Management, Project Management, Task Management, Notification, Audit). Each context has its own domain model, rules, and data ownership with explicit integration contracts with other contexts.

- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**: Captures a significant architectural decision including the problem statement, alternatives considered, chosen solution, and consequences/tradeoffs.

- **Quality Attribute Scenario**: Defines specific, measurable quality requirements using stimulus-response format (e.g., "Given 1000 concurrent users, system responds to API requests in under 500ms at p95").

- **Deployment Unit**: Represents a deployable artifact (containerized service, worker process, database instance). Each unit has resource requirements, scaling rules, health check endpoints, and dependencies on other units.

- **Integration Contract**: Defines the interface between components or bounded contexts including API specifications, message schemas, event formats, and error handling protocols.
