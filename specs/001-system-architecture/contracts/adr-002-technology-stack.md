### Benchmarks

| Metric                  | Target  | FastAPI Capability    | Status     |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| API Requests/sec        | 1,000+  | 20,000+ (single core) | ✅ Exceeds |
| API Response Time (p95) | < 500ms | < 100ms (typical)     | ✅ Exceeds |

## Migration Path

If technology choices prove insufficient:

1. **FastAPI → Django**: Keep domain layer, rewrite interface layer
2. **MySQL → PostgreSQL**: SQLAlchemy makes this straightforward
3. **Celery → AWS Lambda**: Refactor workers to serverless functions
4. **ECS → Kubernetes**: Docker images work on both platforms
5. **Monolith → Microservices**: Bounded contexts provide natural split points

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality Tools

- **Linting**: Ruff (fast Python linter)
- **Formatting**: Black (opinionated formatter)
- **Type Checking**: MyPy (static type analysis)
- **Testing**: pytest + pytest-cov
- **Security**: bandit + safety (dependency scanning)

### Development Environment

- **Python Version Management**: pyenv
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry or pip-tools
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose
- **IDE**: VS Code with Python extensions

---

## Validation Criteria

This decision will be validated by:

1. **Performance Tests**: Load testing confirms <500ms p95 response times
2. **Developer Survey**: Team satisfaction after 2 sprints
3. **Code Quality**: Successful TDD adoption with >90% coverage
4. **Operational Metrics**: System availability meets 99.9% SLA
