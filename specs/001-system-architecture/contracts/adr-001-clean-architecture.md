# ADR-001: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  
**Context Owner**: System Architecture Design

## Context and Problem Statement

The SaaS Task Management Platform requires an architectural pattern that enables long-term maintainability, testability, and scalability while supporting multiple development teams working on different features. We need to decide on the fundamental architectural approach that will guide all implementation decisions.

## Decision Drivers

- **Testability**: Must enable unit testing of business logic without external dependencies
- **Maintainability**: Code should be organized to minimize impact of changes
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple teams should work independently on different domains
- **Technology Independence**: Business logic should not depend on frameworks or databases
- **Constitution Compliance**: Must satisfy Clean Architecture and DDD principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Considered Options

1. **Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
2. Traditional Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
3. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
4. Microservices from Day 1

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design" because it provides the best balance of structure, testability, and team independence while fully satisfying our constitutional requirements.

### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Domain logic is completely isolated from framework concerns
- Business rules can be tested without database, API, or external services
- Clear boundaries enable multiple teams to work on different bounded contexts
- Technology choices can evolve without rewriting business logic
- Explicit domain events enable loose coupling between contexts

**Negative**:

- More initial boilerplate code (interfaces, DTOs, mapping layers)
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with DDD
- Requires discipline to maintain clean boundaries

**Neutral**:

- Repository pattern adds abstraction layer over database access
- Domain events require event bus infrastructure

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Clean Architecture + DDD

**Pros**:

- Maximum testability with no external dependencies in domain
- Clear separation of concerns across four layers
- Bounded contexts enable team autonomy
- Aligns perfectly with constitution requirements
- Battle-tested pattern used by many enterprises

**Cons**:

- More files and abstractions than simpler patterns
- Requires team training on DDD concepts
- Can feel like over-engineering for simple CRUD operations

### Option 2: Traditional Layered Architecture

**Pros**:

- Simpler and more familiar to most developers
- Less boilerplate code initially
- Faster to implement simple features

**Cons**:

- Business logic tends to leak into service layers
- Framework dependencies pollute business rules
- Harder to test in isolation
- Does not satisfy constitutional requirements
- Domain logic becomes coupled to database models

### Option 3: Hexagonal Architecture

**Pros**:

- Similar testability benefits to Clean Architecture
- Clear separation of core from adapters
- Technology independence

**Cons**:

- Less prescriptive about internal organization
- No explicit guidance on domain modeling
- Lacks DDD tactical patterns (aggregates, value objects, etc.)
- Constitution explicitly requires Clean Architecture + DDD

### Option 4: Microservices from Day 1

**Pros**:

- Ultimate deployment independence
- Can use different technologies per service
- Natural team boundaries

**Cons**:

- Massive operational complexity for initial scale
- Network latency and failure modes
- Distributed transaction challenges
- Over-engineering for 10,000 user target
- Can evolve to microservices later using bounded context boundaries

## Implementation Guidelines

### Layer Structure

```
Domain (Core)
    ↑ depends on
Application (Use Cases)
    ↑ depends on
Infrastructure (Implementations)
    ↑ depends on
Interface (API, CLI)
```

### Dependency Rule

Dependencies always point **inward**:

- Domain has zero dependencies (pure Python)
- Application depends only on Domain
- Infrastructure depends on Application and Domain
- Interface depends on all layers

### Bounded Contexts

Organize code by business domain, not technical layer:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   ├── users/        # User Management context
│   ├── projects/     # Project Management context
│   ├── tasks/        # Task Management context
│   ├── notifications/
│   └── audit/
```

Each context contains:

- Entities (objects with identity)
- Value Objects (immutable, defined by attributes)
- Aggregates (consistency boundaries)
- Domain Events (significant state changes)
- Repository Interfaces (collection-like data access)

### Testing Approach

- **Domain Layer**: Pure unit tests, no mocks needed
- **Application Layer**: Unit tests with repository mocks
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Integration tests with real database (test containers)
- **Interface Layer**: Contract tests (OpenAPI validation)

## Validation

This decision will be validated by:

- Successful implementation of first bounded context (User Management)
- Ability to write unit tests for domain logic without database
- Team feedback after 2 sprints of development
- Code review compliance with architecture boundaries
