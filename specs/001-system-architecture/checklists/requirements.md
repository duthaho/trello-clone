# Specification Quality Checklist: System Architecture Design

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Feature**: [001-system-architecture/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without technical HOW
- ✅ User stories describe value to technical stakeholders (architects, engineers) appropriately for architecture documentation
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-015) defines specific architectural deliverables
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (percentages, time durations, specific thresholds)
- ⚠️ NOTE: Some success criteria reference technical metrics (API response time, database query time) but these are expressed as user-observable performance, not implementation details
- ✅ All 5 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section identifies 5 critical scenarios for architecture to address
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to architecture documentation phase (not implementation)
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 6 key assumptions about scale, team, and compliance

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:

- ✅ Each of 15 functional requirements maps to specific architectural deliverables
- ✅ 5 user stories cover all critical aspects: foundation docs, scalability, security, observability, deployment
- ✅ 12 success criteria provide comprehensive measurement framework
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction - describes required capabilities without prescribing solutions

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Summary**: The System Architecture Design specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). All quality gates passed:

- **Completeness**: All mandatory sections fully populated with detailed content
- **Clarity**: No ambiguous requirements or clarification markers
- **Testability**: Each user story has specific, verifiable acceptance scenarios
- **Scope**: Clearly bounded to architectural documentation deliverables
- **Measurability**: Success criteria provide objective validation metrics

**Strengths**:

1. Five well-prioritized user stories covering all architectural dimensions
2. Fifteen comprehensive functional requirements with clear boundaries
3. Detailed edge case analysis addressing failure scenarios
4. Strong success criteria mixing technical metrics with business outcomes
5. Clear separation between architectural decisions and implementation details

**Next Steps**:

- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) should be created during planning phase
- Consider creating architecture diagrams (C4 model) during planning

**No blockers identified** - specification meets all quality standards for enterprise architecture documentation.
