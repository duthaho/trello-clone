## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Architecture Foundation**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **MVP-ready**
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Scalability Guidelines**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 architecture foundation but independently complete
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Security Architecture**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 layer architecture but independently complete
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Observability Framework**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 component architecture but independently complete
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Deployment Strategy**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 system architecture but independently complete

### Within Each User Story

- Documentation with [P] markers can be written in parallel (different files)
- Master index documents (with dependencies on multiple prior tasks) must wait for prerequisites
- Each story should deliver a complete, independently usable documentation set

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All tasks except T001 can run in parallel (T002-T004 depend on directory structure from T001)
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T007, T008, T009 (ADR transfers) can all run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: Tasks T011, T012, T013 can all run in parallel; T014-T017 have dependencies on diagrams/components
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T018, T019, T020 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 3**: Tasks T024, T025, T026, T027 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 4**: Tasks T031, T032, T033 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 5**: Tasks T038, T039, T040 can all run in parallel
- **Phase 8**: Most polish tasks can run in parallel except T050 (link validation) and T054 (final review)

**Once Foundational phase completes, all 5 user stories can start in parallel if team capacity allows**

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Architecture Foundation)

```bash
# Can be written simultaneously by different team members:
Task T011: Transfer system architecture diagrams to docs/architecture/diagrams/01-system-overview.md
Task T012: Create layer responsibilities doc in docs/architecture/layers.md
Task T013: Create component interaction doc in docs/architecture/components.md

# These depend on above tasks completing:
Task T014: Create data flow documentation (references diagrams from T011)
Task T015: Create API architecture documentation
Task T016: Transfer and improve quickstart guide
Task T017: Add architecture glossary
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Security Architecture)

```bash
# All can be written simultaneously:
Task T024: Authentication documentation in docs/architecture/security/authentication.md
Task T025: Authorization documentation in docs/architecture/security/authorization.md
Task T026: Data protection documentation in docs/architecture/security/data-protection.md
Task T027: Audit logging documentation in docs/architecture/security/audit-logging.md

# These integrate the above:
Task T028: OWASP Top 10 compliance checklist (references T024-T027)
Task T029: Security layers documentation (references T024-T027)
Task T030: Master security index (depends on all security docs)
```

- Parallel execution across multiple team members
- Incremental delivery with each story adding value

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = Different files, no dependencies, can be written simultaneously
- **[Story] label** = Maps task to specific user story for traceability and independent delivery
- **Each user story** delivers a complete, independently usable documentation set
- **No tests required**: This feature produces documentation artifacts, not executable code
- **Verification approach**: Design reviews, threat modeling sessions, documentation walkthroughs
- **Integration points**: User stories reference each other (US2-US5 reference US1) but remain independently complete
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical documentation section
- **Stop at any checkpoint**: Each user story can be validated independently before proceeding to next priority
