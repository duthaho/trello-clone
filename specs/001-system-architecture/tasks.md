## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all subsequent phases
- **Project Initialization (Phase 2.5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - BLOCKS implementation work
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational + Project Initialization completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Architecture Foundation**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **MVP-ready**
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Scalability Guidelines**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 architecture foundation but independently complete
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Security Architecture**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 layer architecture but independently complete
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Observability Framework**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 component architecture but independently complete
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Deployment Strategy**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References US1 system architecture but independently complete

### Within Each User Story

- Documentation with [P] markers can be written in parallel (different files)
- Master index documents (with dependencies on multiple prior tasks) must wait for prerequisites
- Each story should deliver a complete, independently usable documentation set

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All tasks except T001 can run in parallel (T002-T004 depend on directory structure from T001)
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T007, T008, T009 (ADR transfers) can all run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: Tasks T011, T012, T013 can all run in parallel; T014-T017 have dependencies on diagrams/components
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T018, T019, T020 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 3**: Tasks T024, T025, T026, T027 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 4**: Tasks T031, T032, T033 can all run in parallel
- **User Story 5**: Tasks T038, T039, T040 can all run in parallel
- **Phase 8**: Most polish tasks can run in parallel except T050 (link validation) and T054 (final review)

**Once Foundational phase completes, all 5 user stories can start in parallel if team capacity allows**

Task T029: Security layers documentation (references T024-T027)
Task T030: Master security index (depends on all security docs)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚úÖ
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories) ‚úÖ
3. Complete Phase 2.5: Project Initialization (CRITICAL - creates code structure) ‚úÖ
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Architecture Foundation Documentation) ‚úÖ
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Conduct design review with engineering team to verify documentation clarity + verify code structure matches architecture
6. Ready for implementation teams to begin bounded context development work

**This delivers**: Comprehensive architecture foundation documentation + initialized codebase structure that enables all subsequent development

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational + Project Initialization ‚Üí Foundation + Code Structure ready ‚úÖ
2. Add User Story 1 (Architecture Foundation) ‚Üí Review independently ‚Üí **MVP delivered! Can start bounded context implementation**
3. Add User Story 2 (Scalability Guidelines) ‚Üí Review independently ‚Üí Development teams can now design for scale
4. Add User Story 3 (Security Architecture) ‚Üí Review independently ‚Üí Security teams can validate compliance
5. Add User Story 4 (Observability Framework) ‚Üí Review independently ‚Üí DevOps teams can prepare production operations
6. Add User Story 5 (Deployment Strategy) ‚Üí Review independently ‚Üí Infrastructure can be provisioned
7. Each story adds value without invalidating previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple technical writers/architects + developer:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer**: Phase 2.5 Project Initialization (14 tasks, many parallel) - Can complete in 1-2 days
3. Once Project Initialization is done (code structure exists):
   - **Writer A**: User Story 1 (Architecture Foundation) - 7 tasks (can reference actual code structure)
   - **Writer B**: User Story 2 (Scalability Guidelines) - 6 tasks
   - **Writer C**: User Story 3 (Security Architecture) - 7 tasks
   - **Writer D**: User Story 4 (Observability Framework) - 7 tasks
   - **Writer E**: User Story 5 (Deployment Strategy) - 7 tasks
4. Stories complete independently and are reviewed separately

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 68 (67 completed ‚úÖ, 1 skipped)

### Task Count by Phase

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 4 tasks ‚úÖ
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 6 tasks ‚úÖ (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)

- **User Story 4 (P2) - Observability Framework**: 7 tasks ‚úÖ
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Deployment Strategy**: 7 tasks ‚úÖ (6 completed, 1 skipped)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: 10 tasks ‚úÖ

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- **Phase 1**: 3 parallel tasks (T002-T004)
- **Phase 2**: 3 parallel tasks (T007-T009)
- **Phase 2.5**: 9 parallel tasks (T010C-T010F, T010H-T010I, T010K, T010M)
- **User Story 1**: 3 parallel tasks initially (T011-T013)

- **Phase 8**: 6 parallel tasks (T045-T046, T048-T049, T051-T052)

**Total parallel opportunities**: ~37 tasks can be executed in parallel at various points

### Independent Test Criteria

Each user story has documented independent validation:

- **US1**: Design review session - teams can answer architecture questions from documentation
- **US2**: Load test scenarios validate documented performance thresholds
- **US3**: STRIDE threat modeling - all threats have documented mitigations
- **US4**: Simulated failure scenarios - documented monitoring provides diagnosis info
- **US5**: Test environment provisioning - deployment procedures work without manual steps

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 2.5 (Project Initialization) + Phase 3 (User Story 1)

**Delivers**: Complete architecture foundation documentation AND initialized codebase structure enabling development teams to immediately begin implementing features with consistent technical decisions.

**Tasks Required**: 31 tasks (T001-T010N + T011-T017)

**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days for single architect/technical writer (3-4 days docs + 2-3 days codebase setup)

**Value**: Development can begin immediately after MVP completion with both documentation guidance and physical code structure in place; other user stories (US2-US5) can be completed in parallel with initial bounded context implementation

- **No tests required**: This feature produces documentation artifacts, not executable code
- **Verification approach**: Design reviews, threat modeling sessions, documentation walkthroughs
- **Integration points**: User stories reference each other (US2-US5 reference US1) but remain independently complete
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical documentation section
- **Stop at any checkpoint**: Each user story can be validated independently before proceeding to next priority
