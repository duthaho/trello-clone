## Security Quick Reference

### Critical Security Principles

```
1. Authentication Required: All protected endpoints require valid JWT
2. Authorization Enforced: Every action checks permissions
3. Organization Isolation: Data scoped by organization_id
4. Input Validation: All user input validated via Pydantic
5. Audit Logging: Security events logged immutably
6. Encryption Everywhere: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
7. Least Privilege: Minimal permissions by default
8. Defense in Depth: Multiple independent security layers
```

### Common Security Tasks

#### Implementing a New Protected Endpoint

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from application.dependencies import get_current_user, require_permission
from domain.user import User

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/resources")
@require_permission("resource:create")
async def create_resource(
    data: CreateResourceRequest,
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Security checklist:
    ‚úÖ Authentication: get_current_user dependency
    ‚úÖ Authorization: @require_permission decorator
    ‚úÖ Input Validation: Pydantic model (CreateResourceRequest)
    ‚úÖ Organization Scope: Repository auto-filters
    ‚úÖ Audit Logging: Use @audit_logged decorator
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

#### Adding a New Permission

```python
# 1. Add permission to domain/authorization/permissions.py
PERMISSION_DEFINITIONS = {
    "resource:create": PermissionDefinition(
        action=PermissionAction.CREATE,
        resource=PermissionResource.RESOURCE,
        description="Create new resources"
    ),
}

# 2. Assign to roles in domain/authorization/roles.py
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    Role.ORG_ADMIN: ["resource:*"],
    Role.PROJECT_MANAGER: ["resource:create", "resource:read"],
    Role.MEMBER: ["resource:read"],
}

# 3. Use in endpoints
@require_permission("resource:create")
async def create_resource(...):
    pass
```

#### Logging Security Events

```python
from application.services.audit_service import AuditService
from domain.audit.audit_action import AuditAction

# Automatic logging via decorator
@audit_logged(action=AuditAction.CREATE)
async def create_resource(...):
    pass

# Manual logging
audit_service.log(
    action=AuditAction.PERMISSION_DENIED,
    entity_type="Resource",
    entity_id=resource_id,
    user=user,
    metadata={"permission": "resource:create"}
)
```

## FAQ

### Q: Where do I start if I'm new to the project?

**A**: Start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above based on your role (Developer, Security Auditor, or Compliance Officer). For developers, begin with [Authentication](./authentication.md) to understand how users log in, then proceed to [Authorization](./authorization.md) to learn about permissions.

---

### Q: How do I implement a new feature that requires authorization?

**A**: Follow this checklist:

1. Define required permissions in [authorization.md](./authorization.md)
2. Use `@require_permission()` decorator on your endpoint
3. Add `user: User = Depends(get_current_user)` dependency
4. Use organization-scoped repositories for data access
5. Add audit logging with `@audit_logged()` decorator
6. Write tests covering all authorization scenarios

---

### Q: What data is considered PII and needs special protection?

**A**: See [data-protection.md](./data-protection.md) Section 4.1 for PII classification:

- **HIGH**: Email, full name, phone, address, SSN
- **MEDIUM**: IP address, user agent, task content, comments
- **LOW**: Login timestamps, activity logs
- **NONE**: System IDs, feature flags, aggregated metrics

---

### Q: How long are audit logs retained?

**A**: See [audit-logging.md](./audit-logging.md) Section 3.3:

- **12 months**: Hot storage (RDS) for all events
- **12-24 months**: Cold storage (S3) for data modifications
- **24 months**: Authentication events
- **60 months**: GDPR-related requests (export, deletion)

---

### Q: What should I do if I discover a security vulnerability?

**A**:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue or discuss in open channels
2. Email security@taskmanager.example.com with details
3. Include: description, impact, steps to reproduce, suggested fix
4. Security team will respond within 24 hours
5. Work with security team on remediation
6. Receive credit in security advisories (if desired)

---

### Q: Are there any security tools I should run locally before committing?

**A**: Yes, run these checks:

```bash
# Python security linting
bandit -r src/

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip-audit

# Secret scanning
gitleaks detect --source .

# Type checking (catches some security issues)
mypy src/
```

---

### Q: How do I test authorization in my code?

**A**: See [authorization.md](./authorization.md) Section 6 for testing examples:

```python
def test_permission_denied_for_viewer():
    user = UserFactory.create(roles=[Role.VIEWER])
    task = TaskFactory.create()

    with pytest.raises(PermissionError):
        authorization_service.check_permission(
            user, "task:delete", task
        )
```

---

### Q: What compliance certifications do we have?

**A**: See [Security Compliance Matrix](#security-compliance-matrix):

- ‚úÖ OWASP Top 10 (2021) - Fully Compliant
- ‚úÖ GDPR - Compliant
- ‚úÖ CIS AWS Foundations - Level 1 Compliant
- üîÑ SOC 2 Type II - In Progress (audit Q2 2026)
