# Technology Choices and Justifications

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Active

## Overview

This document provides the research findings and justifications for the architectural and technology decisions made for the SaaS Task Management Platform. Each decision includes the chosen approach, rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs.

---

## 1. Architectural Pattern: Clean Architecture + DDD

### Decision

Adopt **Clean Architecture** with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** tactical patterns, organizing code by bounded contexts within layered architecture.

### Rationale

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clean Architecture's concentric layers (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Interface) isolate business logic from framework and infrastructure concerns
2. **Testability**: Inner layers (domain, application) can be tested without external dependencies (databases, APIs)
3. **Technology Independence**: Domain layer remains pure Python with zero framework dependencies, enabling framework swaps if needed
4. **Team Scalability**: Bounded contexts enable multiple teams to work independently on different business domains
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to external services or frameworks don't cascade into business logic

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                                   | Why Rejected                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layered Architecture (Traditional)**        | Lacks clear boundaries between business logic and infrastructure; domain logic often leaks into service layers                                            |
| **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** | Similar benefits but less prescriptive about layer organization; Clean Architecture provides clearer guidance for teams                                   |
| **Microservices from Day 1**                  | Over-engineering for initial scale; adds deployment complexity without clear benefits; can evolve to microservices later using bounded context boundaries |
| **Django-style MVC**                          | Framework-centric rather than domain-centric; business logic tends to spread across models, views, and forms                                              |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- High testability and maintainability
- Clear separation enables independent evolution
- Aligns perfectly with constitution requirements

**Cons**:

- More initial boilerplate (repository interfaces, DTOs)
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with DDD
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries

### Best Practices

- Keep domain entities pure Python with no framework imports
- Use repository interfaces in domain, implementations in infrastructure
- Define domain events for cross-context communication
- Use value objects for immutable concepts (Email, Money, etc.)
- Apply aggregates to maintain consistency boundaries

## 2. Web Framework: FastAPI

### Decision

Use **FastAPI** as the web framework for building the RESTful API layer.

### Rationale

1. **Modern Python**: Native async/await support for high concurrency
2. **Automatic Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs auto-generated from code annotations
3. **Type Safety**: Leverages Python type hints with Pydantic for request/response validation
4. **Performance**: One of the fastest Python frameworks (comparable to Node.js and Go)
5. **Developer Experience**: Excellent error messages, intuitive API design
6. **Async First**: Designed for async from ground up, unlike Flask/Django retrofits

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative      | Why Rejected                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Django + DRF** | Heavyweight framework with many opinions; ORM tightly coupled; harder to apply Clean Architecture; synchronous by default |
| **Flask**        | Requires many extensions for production features; less modern async support; manual OpenAPI documentation                 |
| **Falcon**       | Performance-focused but lacks built-in validation and documentation; smaller ecosystem                                    |
| **Tornado**      | Older async framework; less ergonomic than FastAPI; smaller community                                                     |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Excellent performance for concurrent requests
- Built-in OpenAPI support aligns with API-First principle
- Strong typing reduces runtime errors
- Large and growing community

**Cons**:

- Relatively young (released 2018) compared to Django/Flask
- Fewer third-party integrations than Django
- Async programming paradigm requires team familiarity

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on TechEmpower benchmarks:

- FastAPI: ~20,000 requests/second (single core)
- Django: ~3,000 requests/second (single core)
- Flask: ~5,000 requests/second (single core)

Meets our target of 1000+ concurrent users with horizontal scaling.

## 3. Database: MySQL + SQLAlchemy

### Decision

Use **MySQL 8.0+** as the relational database with **SQLAlchemy** ORM and **Alembic** for migrations.

### Rationale

1. **ACID Compliance**: Strong transactional guarantees for financial/business-critical data
2. **Maturity**: Battle-tested for decades in enterprise environments
3. **AWS Integration**: Excellent support via AWS RDS with automated backups, replication
4. **JSON Support**: MySQL 8.0+ has native JSON column type for flexible data
5. **SQLAlchemy**: Database-agnostic ORM enables future database swaps if needed
6. **Team Familiarity**: Assumption that team has SQL database experience

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                   | Why Rejected                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL**                | Excellent choice; rejected only due to team familiarity assumption (MySQL specified in requirements); otherwise equal or superior           |
| **MongoDB**                   | Document database unsuitable for relational data (users → projects → tasks); eventual consistency issues; harder to maintain data integrity |
| **SQLite**                    | Not suitable for production multi-user SaaS; no concurrent write scaling                                                                    |
| **Aurora (MySQL-compatible)** | AWS vendor lock-in; standard MySQL on RDS provides flexibility to migrate if needed                                                         |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Strong consistency guarantees
- Rich query capabilities (joins, transactions, indexes)
- Horizontal scaling via read replicas
- Mature tooling and monitoring

**Cons**:

- Vertical scaling limits (though sufficient for target scale)
- Schema migrations require planning
- Less flexible than NoSQL for rapidly evolving schemas

### Scaling Strategy

- **Vertical Scaling**: Up to 64 vCPUs, 256 GB RAM on RDS (sufficient for 100,000+ users)
- **Read Replicas**: Scale read traffic horizontally (reporting, analytics)
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy pool manager + PgBouncer/ProxySQL
- **Caching**: Redis reduces database load for frequently accessed data

**See Also**: [ADR-002: Technology Stack](./decisions/adr-002-technology-stack.md)

---

## 4. Caching & Message Broker: Redis

### Decision

Use **Redis 7.0+** for both caching and as the Celery message broker.

### Rationale

1. **Dual Purpose**: Single technology serves multiple needs (cache + broker)
2. **Performance**: In-memory data structure store with sub-millisecond latency
3. **Rich Data Types**: Supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets
4. **Persistence Options**: RDB snapshots and AOF logs for durability
5. **AWS Integration**: AWS ElastiCache provides managed Redis with automatic failover
6. **Celery Compatibility**: Native support as Celery broker and result backend

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                 | Why Rejected                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memcached**               | Cache-only; would need separate broker (RabbitMQ); less feature-rich than Redis    |
| **RabbitMQ**                | Excellent message broker but adds complexity; would need separate caching solution |
| **Amazon SQS**              | AWS-specific; vendor lock-in; doesn't support caching; higher latency than Redis   |
| **In-Memory (Application)** | Doesn't work with horizontally scaled stateless services; no shared state          |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Single technology reduces operational complexity
- Extremely fast for caching and message passing
- Rich feature set (pub/sub, streams, etc.)
- Horizontal scaling via Redis Cluster

**Cons**:

- In-memory: Limited by RAM capacity
- Persistence is slower than disk-based databases
- Single point of failure unless configured with replication

### Usage Patterns

**Caching**:

- User sessions (JWT validation data)
- Frequently accessed project/task data
- API rate limiting counters
- Database query result caching

**Message Broker**:

- Celery task queues (email sending, notifications)
- Domain event bus between bounded contexts
- Background job processing

**See Also**: [Caching Strategy](./caching.md)

---

## 5. Async Task Queue: Celery

### Decision

Use **Celery** with **Redis broker** for asynchronous background job processing.

### Rationale

1. **Mature Ecosystem**: Industry standard for Python async tasks since 2009
2. **Distributed**: Horizontal scaling by adding worker processes
3. **Reliability**: Task retry, result persistence, dead letter queues
4. **Monitoring**: Flower dashboard for task monitoring
5. **Flexible Scheduling**: Cron-like periodic tasks (celery-beat)

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative          | Why Rejected                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RQ (Redis Queue)** | Simpler but less feature-rich; no task routing, no periodic tasks; not suitable for enterprise scale |
| **AWS Lambda**       | Serverless adds complexity; cold start latency; harder to debug; vendor lock-in                      |
| **Dramatiq**         | Modern alternative but smaller community; fewer integrations; less battle-tested                     |
| **APScheduler**      | In-process scheduler; doesn't support distributed workers; not suitable for high-volume tasks        |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Battle-tested at scale (used by Robinhood, Instagram, etc.)
- Rich feature set (retries, rate limiting, task chaining)
- Excellent monitoring and debugging tools
- Supports multiple queue priorities

**Cons**:

- Complex configuration for advanced features
- Python-only (can't share workers with other languages)
- Requires careful tuning for optimal performance

### Use Cases

- **Email Sending**: Transactional emails, digests, notifications
- **Report Generation**: PDF exports, CSV downloads
- **Data Aggregation**: Analytics, metrics calculation
- **Webhook Delivery**: External system integrations
- **Cleanup Tasks**: Old data purging, cache warming

**See Also**: [ADR-002: Technology Stack](./decisions/adr-002-technology-stack.md)

## 6. Observability: Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry

### Decision

Use **Prometheus** for metrics collection, **Grafana** for visualization, and **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing.

### Rationale

1. **Industry Standard**: Prometheus is the de facto standard for cloud-native monitoring
2. **Pull Model**: Prometheus scrapes metrics; no agent pushing data
3. **Time-Series DB**: Efficient storage and querying of metrics over time
4. **Alertmanager**: Built-in alerting with multiple notification channels
5. **Grafana Integration**: Rich visualization with pre-built dashboards
6. **OpenTelemetry**: Vendor-neutral tracing standard; future-proof

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                                     | Why Rejected                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Datadog**                                     | Excellent SaaS solution but expensive at scale; vendor lock-in; $15-30/host/month            |
| **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Resource-intensive; complex to operate; better for logs than metrics                         |
| **CloudWatch**                                  | AWS-specific; higher latency; less flexible querying; more expensive for high-volume metrics |
| **New Relic**                                   | SaaS APM with high costs; $99-349/host/month; vendor lock-in                                 |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Open source with no licensing costs
- Flexible deployment (self-hosted or managed)
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Active community and ecosystem

**Cons**:

- Requires operational expertise to run
- Limited long-term storage (typically 15-30 days)
- No built-in authentication (requires reverse proxy)

### Metrics to Collect

**Application Metrics**:

- HTTP request rate, latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- Active connections, database pool usage
- Celery task queue depth, task latency

**Business Metrics**:

- User registrations, logins
- Projects/tasks created per hour
- API usage by tenant
- Feature adoption rates

**Infrastructure Metrics**:

- CPU, memory, disk usage
- Database connections, query latency
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Container health status

**See Also**: [Observability Framework](./observability/README.md)

## 7. Deployment: Docker + AWS ECS

### Decision

Use **Docker** for containerization with **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)** for orchestration.

### Rationale

1. **Consistency**: "Works on my machine" problem solved; dev = staging = prod
2. **AWS Native**: ECS is deeply integrated with AWS services (ALB, RDS, ElastiCache)
3. **Simpler Than K8s**: Lower operational overhead compared to Kubernetes
4. **Cost Effective**: No Kubernetes control plane costs; pay only for EC2/Fargate
5. **Auto Scaling**: Integrated with AWS Auto Scaling based on metrics
6. **Team Familiarity**: Assumption that team has AWS experience

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                    | Why Rejected                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kubernetes (EKS)**           | Over-engineering for initial scale; steeper learning curve; higher operational costs (~$75/month for control plane); can migrate later if needed |
| **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**      | Higher-level abstraction but less control; harder to apply Clean Architecture patterns; legacy service                                           |
| **AWS Lambda (Serverless)**    | Cold start latency; 15-minute timeout; harder to debug; not suitable for long-running connections                                                |
| **EC2 Direct (No Containers)** | No consistency guarantees; harder deployment; manual scaling; pets vs cattle                                                                     |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Lower complexity than Kubernetes
- Native AWS integration
- Good balance of control and simplicity
- Lower costs for initial scale

**Cons**:

- AWS vendor lock-in (mitigated by Docker portability)
- Less portable than Kubernetes
- Fewer advanced features than K8s (service mesh, etc.)

### Deployment Strategy

**Container Images**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized production builds
- Python 3.11 slim base image (~150 MB final image)
- Separate images for API, Celery workers, beat scheduler

**Task Definitions**:

- API service: 2-10 tasks with auto-scaling (CPU/memory thresholds)
- Celery workers: 2-5 tasks with queue depth-based scaling
- Celery beat: 1 task (singleton for scheduling)

**Networking**:

- Application Load Balancer for API traffic distribution
- Security groups for service isolation
- Private subnets for workers and databases

**CI/CD Pipeline**:

- GitHub Actions for build and test
- Push Docker images to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Rolling deployments with health checks
- Automatic rollback on failed health checks

**See Also**: [Deployment Strategy](./deployment/README.md)

## 8. API Versioning Strategy

### Decision

Use **URI path versioning** (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`) for API version management.

### Rationale

1. **Explicit**: Version is immediately visible in URL
2. **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand
3. **Caching Friendly**: Different versions have different cache keys
4. **Client-Side Control**: Clients choose which version to use
5. **Gradual Migration**: Old versions stay available during transition

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                             | Why Rejected                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header Versioning**                   | Less visible; requires API gateway or middleware; harder to test in browsers |
| **Query Parameter**                     | Pollutes URLs; easy to forget; not RESTful                                   |
| **Content Negotiation (Accept header)** | Complex; harder to debug; poor tooling support                               |
| **Subdomain Versioning**                | Requires DNS changes; complicates TLS certificates; over-engineered          |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Clear and explicit
- RESTful approach
- Easy debugging and testing

**Cons**:

- URL changes between versions
- May lead to version proliferation if not managed

### Versioning Policy

- **MAJOR version** (v1 → v2): Breaking changes to contracts
- **Deprecation period**: Minimum 6 months for old versions
- **Security patches**: Applied to all supported versions
- **Documentation**: Maintain docs for current + previous major version

**See Also**: [API Design](./api-design.md)

---

## 9. Authentication & Authorization Strategy

### Decision

Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication with **OAuth2 flows**, and **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** for authorization.

### Rationale

1. **Stateless**: JWT tokens enable horizontal API scaling without session affinity
2. **Standard**: OAuth2 is industry standard for API authentication
3. **Flexible**: Supports multiple grant types (password, refresh token, authorization code)
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Token-based auth works seamlessly with mobile apps
5. **RBAC**: Role-based model is sufficient for enterprise use cases

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                | Why Rejected                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session-Based Auth**     | Requires sticky sessions or distributed session store; harder to scale horizontally   |
| **API Keys Only**          | No user identity; no expiration; can't be revoked easily; security risk               |
| **SAML**                   | XML-based; complex; primarily for enterprise SSO; overkill for initial implementation |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based)** | More complex than needed; RBAC sufficient for initial requirements                    |

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Scalable and stateless
- Industry-standard approach
- Rich ecosystem of libraries

**Cons**:

- Token revocation requires additional infrastructure (Redis blacklist)
- Larger payload than session IDs
- Requires careful expiration management

### Implementation Details

**JWT Payload**:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "roles": ["admin", "user"],
  "exp": 1640000000,
  "tenant_id": "org_123"
}
```

**Token Lifecycle**:

- Access token: 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token: 30-day expiration
- Refresh token rotation on use

**Roles**:

- `super_admin`: Platform administration
- `org_admin`: Organization management
- `project_manager`: Project and task management
- `user`: Basic task and project access
- `viewer`: Read-only access

**See Also**: [Security Architecture](./security/README.md)

## 10. Testing Strategy

### Decision

Implement **Test Pyramid** approach with unit tests (70%), integration tests (20%), and contract tests (10%).

### Rationale

1. **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run quickly, providing rapid feedback during development
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple test levels catch different bug classes
3. **Confidence**: High coverage reduces regression risks
4. **Constitution Requirement**: TDD is NON-NEGOTIABLE per constitution

### Test Levels

**Unit Tests (70% of tests)**:

- Domain entities, value objects, business rules
- Application services and use cases
- Pure functions and utilities
- Target: >90% code coverage
- Fast: <1ms per test
- No external dependencies (databases, APIs, files)

**Integration Tests (20% of tests)**:

- Repository implementations with real database (test containers)
- Celery workers with real Redis
- External service adapters (with mocking for third-party APIs)
- API endpoints with real HTTP requests
- Slower: ~100ms per test

**Contract Tests (10% of tests)**:

- OpenAPI specification compliance
- Request/response schema validation
- Backward compatibility checks
- Breaking change detection

### Tools

- **pytest**: Test framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking and patching
- **testcontainers**: Docker containers for integration tests
- **Hypothesis**: Property-based testing for domain logic

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow (example)
- Run linting (ruff, black, mypy)
- Run unit tests (fast)
- Run integration tests (slower)
- Generate coverage report (fail if <80%)
- Run contract tests
- Build Docker image
- Deploy to staging (on main branch)
```
