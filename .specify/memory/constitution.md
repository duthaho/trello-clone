# SaaS Task Management Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The system MUST follow Clean Architecture principles with strict layer separation:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, and domain services. MUST be framework-agnostic with no external dependencies.
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases and application services. MUST orchestrate domain logic without containing business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Contains implementations for persistence (SQLAlchemy), external services (Redis, Celery), and frameworks (FastAPI).
- **Interface Layer**: Contains API controllers, request/response models, and presentation logic.

**Dependency Rule**: Dependencies MUST only point inward. Inner layers MUST NOT depend on outer layers.

**Rationale**: Ensures testability, maintainability, and technology independence. Business logic remains protected from framework changes.

### II. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The system MUST apply DDD tactical patterns and strategic design:

- **Bounded Contexts**: User Management, Project Management, Task Management, Notification, Audit contexts are explicitly separated.
- **Aggregates**: Each aggregate MUST enforce invariants and maintain consistency boundaries (e.g., Project aggregate manages Tasks).
- **Entities & Value Objects**: Use entities for objects with identity, value objects for immutable descriptive concepts.
- **Domain Events**: MUST be emitted for significant business state changes to enable loose coupling.
- **Repositories**: MUST provide collection-like interfaces for aggregate persistence, hiding infrastructure details.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Code MUST reflect business terminology consistently across team and codebase.

**Rationale**: Aligns code with business domain, reduces complexity through bounded contexts, and improves communication between technical and business stakeholders.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD MUST be followed for all feature development with strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

- **Red**: Write failing tests FIRST (unit and integration tests) based on acceptance criteria.
- **Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass.
- **Refactor**: Improve code structure while keeping tests green.

**Testing Requirements**:

- Unit tests for domain entities, value objects, and use cases (target: >90% coverage)
- Integration tests for repositories, external service interactions, and API endpoints
- Contract tests for API specifications (OpenAPI compliance)
- All tests MUST pass before any PR merge

**Rationale**: Ensures correctness, prevents regression, and drives better design through testability pressure.

### IV. API-First Design

All features MUST begin with API contract definition before implementation:

- **OpenAPI 3.0**: Define endpoints, request/response schemas, and error responses FIRST.
- **RESTful Principles**: Follow REST constraints (resources, HTTP verbs, status codes, HATEOAS where appropriate).
- **Versioning**: Use URI versioning (`/api/v1/`) for breaking changes; maintain backward compatibility within versions.
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI specs MUST be auto-generated and kept in sync; include examples and descriptions.
- **Contract Testing**: Validate implementation against OpenAPI spec in integration tests.

**Rationale**: Enables parallel frontend/backend development, provides clear contracts, and ensures consistent API design.

### V. Observability & Operations

The system MUST be production-ready with comprehensive observability:

- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs, context, and severity levels. No PII in logs.
- **Metrics**: Instrument with Prometheus metrics (request rates, latency percentiles, error rates, business metrics).
- **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for request flows across services/workers.
- **Health Checks**: Implement `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for container orchestration.
- **Monitoring Dashboards**: Maintain Grafana dashboards for key business and technical metrics.
- **Alerting**: Define SLIs/SLOs and configure alerts for degradation or failures.

**Rationale**: Enables rapid incident detection, troubleshooting, and system understanding in production environments.

### VI. Security by Design

Security MUST be embedded in every layer following OWASP Top 10 and best practices:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism; OAuth2 for third-party integration.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at API and domain layers.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs at API boundaries using Pydantic models.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM parameterized queries exclusively; no raw SQL without review.
- **Secrets Management**: Store secrets in environment variables or secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager); NEVER in code.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest; use HTTPS/TLS for all communications.
- **Audit Trail**: Log all security-relevant events (authentication, authorization failures, data access).
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using safety/pip-audit.

**Rationale**: Protects user data, maintains trust, and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.

### VII. Modularity & Scalability

The system MUST be designed for horizontal scalability and independent module deployment:

- **Stateless Services**: API services MUST be stateless to enable horizontal scaling behind load balancers.
- **Async Processing**: Long-running operations (emails, notifications, reports) MUST use Celery workers with Redis broker.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data with appropriate TTLs and cache invalidation.
- **Database Design**: Optimize for read/write patterns; use indexes appropriately; consider read replicas for scaling.
- **Feature Modules**: Organize code by bounded context/feature, not technical layer, for independent evolution.
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configuration (dev/staging/prod) via environment variables or config files.

**Rationale**: Supports growth in users and data volume, enables independent team work on features, and reduces deployment risks.

## Technology Stack Standards

### Core Technologies (MUST USE)

- **Backend Framework**: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI for async-first API development
- **ORM & Migrations**: SQLAlchemy (declarative models) with Alembic for database migrations
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ with InnoDB engine for transactional workloads
- **Caching**: Redis 7.0+ for session storage, caching, and Celery broker
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker for background job processing
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds; Docker Compose for local development
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (ECS for container orchestration, RDS for MySQL, ElastiCache for Redis)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines

### Development Tools (REQUIRED)

- **Code Quality**: Ruff (linting), Black (formatting), MyPy (type checking)
- **Testing**: Pytest with pytest-cov (coverage), pytest-asyncio (async tests), pytest-mock (mocking)
- **API Documentation**: FastAPI auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger UI
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), ELK Stack or OpenTelemetry (logs/traces)
- **Version Control**: Git with Conventional Commits format for commit messages

### Prohibited Practices

- ❌ Storing secrets or credentials in code or version control
- ❌ Using `SELECT *` or raw SQL without explicit review and justification
- ❌ Bypassing ORM for performance without benchmarking and documentation
- ❌ Synchronous blocking operations in API request handlers
- ❌ Global state or singletons that prevent independent testing
- ❌ Tight coupling between bounded contexts

## Quality Gates & Development Workflow

## Governance

### Constitution Authority

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions. In case of conflict between this Constitution and other guidance:

1. Constitution principles take precedence
2. Team discusses whether Constitution needs amendment
3. Amendment follows formal change process (see below)

### Compliance Verification

- All PRs MUST include Constitution compliance verification in review checklist
- Automated CI checks enforce testability, code quality, and security standards
- Monthly architecture review meetings assess adherence to Clean Architecture and DDD principles
- Quarterly security audits verify compliance with security requirements

### Amendment Process

Constitution amendments require:

1. **Proposal**: Written proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. **Discussion**: Team review and discussion of implications
3. **Approval**: Unanimous consent for NON-NEGOTIABLE principles; majority vote for other sections
4. **Documentation**: Update Constitution with version bump following semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Changes to NON-NEGOTIABLE principles or removal of core requirements
   - **MINOR**: Addition of new principles or significant expansion of guidance
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, examples, or non-semantic improvements
5. **Migration Plan**: Document changes needed in existing code to comply with amendment
6. **Communication**: Announce changes to entire team with transition timeline

### Runtime Development Guidance

For detailed implementation guidance, developers MUST consult:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Development workflow and coding standards
- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` - Specific rule files for architecture, testing, security
- `.specify/templates/*.md` - Specification and planning templates

### Complexity Justification

Any deviation from Constitution principles (e.g., bypassing ORM, skipping tests, tight coupling) MUST:

- Be documented in PR with explicit justification
- Include analysis of simpler alternatives and why they were rejected
- Receive explicit approval from tech lead or architect
- Be tracked as technical debt with plan for remediation
